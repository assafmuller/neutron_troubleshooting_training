*Neutron Troubleshooting Training*

The training covers a set of practical exercises. It assumes OpenStack was installed using https://www.rdoproject.org/rdo-manager, and that you're running the scripts from the undercloud machine. It should be easy to generalize this to any deployment tool or topology.

Each exercise is comprised of a bash script that deploys the exercise, and another one that undos it. It is further accompanied by slides located here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-b4MPbch5gvTUotWjVBS0xPV28. There's an 'instructions' slide to be shown before and during the exercise, as well as slides explaining what happened, some theoretical background, and how to solve the problem.
